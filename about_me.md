I started learning to make game some time ago, though I didn't get that far. My programming
skills at that time where terrible. I'm mostly familiar with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 
as a programming language (tho my first language was [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), but I didn' use it that much).
And as of recently I'm curious about [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp)! ([Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp) more concretely).
