I started learning to make videogames some time ago, though I didn't get that far. My programming
skills at that time where terrible. I'm mostly familiar with the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 
programming language (tho my first language was [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), but I didn' use it that much).
And as of recently I'm curious about [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp)! ([Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp) more concretely).

## Games

- [Asteritos](https://chadow.itch.io/asteritos)  
    > Asteroids clone made for the 5th Gosu Game Jam. 

## Projects/Libraries

    > Wrapper around Gosu and MRuby to run Gosu games natively on desktop platforms.
- [AniRuby](https://github.com/Chadowo/aniruby)  
    > Make sprite animations on Gosu, simply and easily.
