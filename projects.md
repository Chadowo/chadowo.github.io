subtitle: Things that I made

As it is now, I've worked on a small share of projects, most of it are small libraries or things,
making games takes time and while I do have kind of a lot of little games in my backburner, they are
really primitive and kinda bad IMO, so it's not something I can proudly share (Θ︹Θ)ს.

## Games

---

- [Asteritos](https://chadow.itch.io/asteritos)
  > Asteroids clone made for the [5th Gosu Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gosu-game-jam-5), also my first finished game! 
- [Pong Taylor](https://github.com/chadowo/pong-taylor)
  > The classic pong recreated in the [Taylor game framework](https://github.com/HellRok/Taylor).
- [Flappy Defold](https://chadow.itch.io/flappy-defold)
  > Flappy Bird made using the [Defold game engine](https://defold.com), to familiarize myself with the engine.

## Projects/Libraries

---

- [Gosu MRuby Wrapper](https://github.com/Chadowo/gosu-mruby-wrapper)  
    > Wrapper around Gosu and MRuby to run Gosu games natively on desktop platforms.
- [AniRuby](https://github.com/Chadowo/aniruby)  
    > Create sprite animations on Gosu, simply and easily.
