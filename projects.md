As it is now, I've worked on a small share of projects, most of it are small libraries or things,
making games takes time and while I do have kind of a lot of little games in my backburner, they are
really bad IMO, so it's not something I can proudly share (Θ︹Θ)ს.

## Games

- Asteritos <a href="https://chadow.itch.io/asteritos"><img src="icons/itchdotio.svg" alt="itch.io" width=24 height=24 style="vertical-align:top"></a>
  > Asteroids clone made for the 5th Gosu Game Jam.  


## Projects/Libraries

- [Gosu MRuby Wrapper](https://github.com/Chadowo/gosu-mruby-wrapper)  
    > Wrapper around Gosu and MRuby to run Gosu games natively on desktop platforms.
- [AniRuby](https://github.com/Chadowo/aniruby)  
    > Make sprite animations on Gosu, simply and easily.
